# LinkedList
Data structures and algorithms exercise from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists">The Odin Project</a>
Made a linked list with various different methods like:
* append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
* prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
* size returns the total number of nodes in the list
* head returns the first node in the list
* tail returns the last node in the list
* at(index) returns the node at the given index
* pop removes the last element from the list
* contains(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
* find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
* toString represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null
* Extra credit
* insertAt(value, index) that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
* removeAt(index) that removes the node at the given index.
